# tk-unity (Shotgun engine for Unity)

## Documentation
This repository is part of the [Shotgun for Unity](https://forum.unity.com/threads/introducing-autodesk-shotgun-for-unity-editor.815286/) system.

Refer to the setup documentation in the [`com.unity.integrations.shotgun`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.integrations.shotgun@0.9/manual/index.html) package.

The [`tk-unity`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/tk-unity) repository allows pipeline TDs to add support for Unity in a Shotgun pipeline configuration. You can see an example configuration using `tk-unity` by looking at the [`tk-config-unity`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/tk-config-unity) repository.

[Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome.
