        # Create the Shotgun menu based on the available actions
        #
        # Traditionally, the menu is built the following way:
        #
        # - First create the Context menu, which is a folder that has a bunch of actions
        #   in it like showing the About box and adding actions to reload Toolkit.
        # - Then there's a separator and a list of favorites.
        # - Finally, there's a separator and a list of folders for each Toolkit application that
        #   has more than one command. If an app has a single command, then there is single entry
        #   instead of a folder.
        #
        # Building the menu is done by performing three passes on the list of commands:
        #
        # - The first pass takes every context actions, removes them from the list and adds them to the
        #   Context menu.
        # - Add a separator.
        # - The second pass takes every favorites and, removes them from the list of commands
        #   and lists them in the Shotgun menu.
        # - Add a separator.
        # - Sort the remaining actions into sub-menus, one per application. If an application
        #   has a single action, then you have a single item instead of a sub-menu.        
        #
        # Not all commands are part of an app. For example, the Restart Engine and
        # Toggle Debug commands.
        #
        # The first entry of the Shotgun menu is a sub-menu named after
        # the current context (calling str on self.context will generate a human readable string),
        # and contains all commands that don't have an app or whose properties
        # key have the type set to context_menu.
        #
        # Then each app has its folder with all its commands inserted inside it, unless
        # there is a single command for that app. In that case the menu
        # entry will be placed at the root level of the menu.
